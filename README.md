# Project-01-Vehicle-Price-Prediction
The price of a car depends on a lot of factors like the goodwill of the brand of the car, features of the car, horsepower and the mileage it gives and many more. Car price prediction is one of the major research areas in machine learning.   In this project, I am going to Apply Data science techniques to Undertand the core features of the data and  build a Machine Learning and deep learning models to predict the car sale price.
